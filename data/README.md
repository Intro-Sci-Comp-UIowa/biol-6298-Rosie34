# Whole-genome landscape of histone H2AX and gamma-H2AX
I downloaded this data from GEO database in Feb 25th and this file is SOFT formatted.
# Figure 1B heatmap 
Since my paper did not share the correlation data, I inserted all coefficients on Excel and made a chart. 

# ChIP-Seq data
Since they are all bed files and too big to upload, I want to write all GEO database numbers. I am trying to compress files to upload here.
