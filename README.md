Hot spots of DNA double-strand breaks in human rDNA units are produced in vivo
(Tchutikov, N.A. et al. Hot spots of DNA double-strand breaks in human rDNA units are produced in vivo. Sci. Rep. 6, 25866 doi: 10.1038/srep25866(2016))

#Introduction
Recently, nine hot spots double-strand breaks (DSBs) are detected in human rDNA genes inside the intergenic spacer (IGS)in HECK293T cell lines. In this paper, the authors investigated to identify whether these hot spots are generated in vivo or in vitro by comparing the pattern of DSBs and DSBs biomarkers. When phosphorylation on serine 139, H2AX is called gamma-H2AX and it is used as a novel biomarker of DNA damage especially in vivo DSBs because it is the first step in recruiting and localizing DNA repair proteins. In this paper, they discovered the pattern of these nine hot spots coincides with the profiles of H2AX or gamma-H2AX. Thus, they reported that nine hot spots are generated in vivo only.

#Figure Explanation
Figure 1B is a heatmap indicating the correlation between DSB hot spots, H2AX, and gamma-H2AX. To test this correlation, they used three different cells which are CD4+ T lymphocytes (irradiated or not irradiated) and Jurket (T-cell lymphoma culture cells). This reason why they used T lymphocytes is that they are resting cells and are not prone to replication stress. They, only transcriptional
