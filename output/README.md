The relationship between hot spots of DSBs and histone biomarkers inside rDNA units.
Correlation heatmaps of pairwise comparisons between median signals for DSBs in HEK29K cells, and H2AX and γ-H2AX marks in CD4+ Jurkat cells inside the rDNA unit are shown. Pearson’s coefficient, r^2, represents the relationship and between 0.53 and 0.64 indicating a strong positive relationship between DSB and histone marks. 


This reproduced heatmap shows both γ-H2AX and H2AX have a strong correlation with DSBs indicating not only γ-H2AX but also H2AX could be used as a good DSB biomarker. Therefore, the distribution of DSB hot spots can be mapped by chipping H2AX biomarkers even before DSB induction. However, the function of H2AX and the reason why H2AX is related to DSB is still exclusive.  
This reproduced heatmap figure is similar to the original figure. However, the reproduced color key, and font sizes still need to be adjusted.
